defmodule MBTAV3API.RoutePatterns.RoutePattern do
  @moduledoc """
  Route patterns are used to describe the subsets of a route, representing different
  possible patterns of where trips may serve. For example, a bus route may have multiple
  branches, and each branch may be modeled as a separate route pattern per direction.
  Hierarchically, the route pattern level may be considered to be larger than the trip
  level and smaller than the route level.

  For most MBTA modes, a route pattern will typically represent a unique set of stops
  that may be served on a route-trip combination. Seasonal schedule changes may result
  in trips within a route pattern having different routings. In simple changes, such a
  single bus stop removed or added between one schedule rating and the next (for example,
  between the Summer and Fall schedules), trips will be maintained on the same
  route_pattern_id. If the changes are significant, a new route_pattern_id may be introduced.

  For Commuter Rail, express or skip-stop trips use the same route pattern as local trips.
  Some branches do have multiple route patterns when the train takes a different path.
  For example, CR-Providence has two route patterns per direction, one for the Wickford
  Junction branch and the other for the Stoughton branch.
