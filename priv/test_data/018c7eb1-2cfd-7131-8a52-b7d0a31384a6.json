Shuttle buses will stop at all D Branch stations, except for Beaconsfield. Below are some additional alternate travel options that D Branch riders may consider. \r\n\r\nExpress shuttles will be operating every 30 minutes between Copley and Riverside / Woodland during peak hours, 6 -10 AM to Copley and 3 - 7 PM to Riverside.\r\n\r\nAlternate Travel Options via Green Line and Bus:\r\n\r\nReservoir - C Branch stop at Cleveland Circle, about a 5 minute walk. Fares will not be collected at Cleveland Circle.\r\nBeaconsfield - C Branch stop at Dean Road, about a 4 minute walk\r\nBrookline Hills - Route 60 service, which is available at the intersection of Route 9 and Cypress St, about a 4 minute walk\r\nBrookline Village - E Branch at Riverway, about a 7 minute walk. Additionally, bus routes 60, 65, and 66 are available at Washington St @ Walnut St, about a 5 minute walk. \r\nLongwood - C Branch stop Kent Street, about a 9 minute walk. \r\nFenway - C Branch stop Saint Mary's Street, about a 5 minute walk\r\n\r\nAlternate Travel Options via Commuter Rail:\r\nRiders who would typically board at Riverside and Woodland may consider the Auburndale and West Newton stops on the Framingham/Worcester Line for service to Lansdowne, Back Bay, and South Station. Lansdowne is about a 7 minute walk from Kenmore. Bus routes 8, 19, 60, and 65 are available on Brookline Ave which is about a 1 minute walk from Lansdowne. These routes serve the Longwood Medical Area and Kenmore.\r\n\r\nNo Shuttles at Beaconsfield:\r\nWhy do shuttles skip Beaconsfield? Due to narrow roads near Beaconsfield, shuttles cannot safely stop there. We recommend taking the Green Line C Branch from Dean Road, about a 4 minute walk.\r\n\r\nAffected stops:\r\nKenmore\r\nFenway\r\nLongwood\r\nBrookline Village\r\nBrookline Hills\r\nBeaconsfield\r\nReservoir\r\nChestnut Hill\r\nNewton Centre\r\nNewton Highlands\r\nEliot\r\nWaban\r\nWoodland\r\nRiverside","effect":"SHUTTLE","header":"Green Line D Branch: Shuttle buses are replacing service between Riverside and Kenmore for track work.
